# text-editor-application

This application is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

### Test the deployed application on Heroku [here](https://text-editor-mikayla.herokuapp.com/)
